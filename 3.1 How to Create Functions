#Functions perform Specific Tasks

#Functions are like mini programs that allow us to perform a specific task

--->Menu Prices Go In ---> Code Calcs the average ---> Average of prices comes out
---> Daily customers go in ---> Code calculates the average ----> Average of daily customers comes out

The code performing these calculations is a function

*Some Functions we used before
We've been using functions all along, like print() -> print('Welcome to the Spam Van!')

The String 'Welcome to the Spam Van! -> print() -> Output to console

Another function we seen before, range() -> my_list = range(10)

The number 10 -> range() -> Return a list from 0 to 9

**Making Our Our Function
1) What is the function name?
2) What data do we send into the function? 
3) What data comes out of the function? 

Step One: Naming the Function
The name of the fucntion is average

def average():
Every function starts with def, is given a name(average) and a colon(:) which makrs the begining of the functions code.

Step Two:Declaring Function Parameters
These parameters are varilables that can be used in the function

def average(prices):
parameters(prices) = Any variables we need the function to use 

Step Three: Return Data From The Function
def average(prices):
  ...................
  
  return avg
  
All code inside of the function is indented
Return value: Functions may or may not return values- this function returns the values of a variable called avg

! Returning data from a function is optional


Putting Code in the average() Function

Our code from Level 2
# Average Price
total = 0
prices = [29, 21, 55, 10]
for price in prices:
    total = total + price
    
avg = total/len(prices)
print(avg)

New Code

def average(prices):
    total = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        total = total + price
        
    avg = total/len(prices)
    return avg
    
    
CALLING THE AVERAGE FUNCTION
Functions don't run until you call them

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
my_average = average(numbers) #average is the function call, Our parameter is a list of numbers
print(my_average)

Output
3
#my_average now contains the value 3 - the result of calling the average function

GENERALIZING OUR average() Function
We want to use our Function for getting teh average for other lists of numbers, not just prices

Before(BAD)
def average(prices):
    total = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        total = total + price
        
    avg = total/len(prices)
    return avg
    
After
def average(numbers):
    total = 0
    
    for num in numbers:
        total = total + num
        
    avg = total/len(numbers)
    return avg
    
HOW OUR FUNCTION EXECUTES CODE

This is our file with our function defined, followed by our main program where we use our function 

def average(numbers):
    total = 0
    
    for num in numbers:
        total = total + num
        
    avg = total/len(numbers)
    return avg
    
# Use our function on prices
prices = [2.50, 3, 4.50, 5]

result = average(prices)

print(result)
