     for line in dollar_spam:

def read_dollar_menu():
     dollar_spam = open('dollar_menu.txt', 'r')
     
     dollar_menu = []
     for line in dollar_spam:
         line = line.strip() #str.strip removes any leading or trailing whitespace
         dollar_menu.append(line)
         
     print(dollar_menu)
     dollar_spam.close()
