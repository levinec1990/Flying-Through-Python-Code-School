OpenWeatherMap.org provides an API for looking up weather forecasts. We'll use our previously installed requests module to connect to their website's API and download the daily current temperature for our circus in Orlando, FL.

The url we will use is "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Orlando,fl&units=imperial&appid=2de143494c0b295cca9337e1e96b00e0"

The first part connects to their API: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather. Then you can see we set q=Orlando,fl for the location, units=imperial for Fahrenheit, and finally we have an appid=... which you can sign up for on their website if you have an app that's using their service.

import requests
  
url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Orlando,fl&units=imperial&appid=2de143494c0b295cca9337e1e96b00e0"
request = requests.get(url)

weather_json = request.json()
print(weather_json)
weather_main = weather_json['main']
temp = weather_main['temp']

print("The Circus's current temperature is ", temp)
