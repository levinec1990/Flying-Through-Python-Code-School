#Now we'll use some Python tricks we haven't seen before. 
#The performance is separated from the time by a dash ' - '. 
#We can divide that string by using line.split(' - ') and this will return two separate things: the show and the time.

#Reading Into a Dictionary 4.7
#Now that we have the performance and time from each line in our file, 
#let's save them into a dictionary.
